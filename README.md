Lonely Planet CouchDB tools
===========================

Just a bunch of useful scripts the [dev/ops team](http://lplabs.com) at [Lonely Planet](http://www.lonelyplanet.com) find useful for deploying and doing sysadmin type tasks on our CouchDB servers. Who knows, maybe someone else might find them useful as well.

Any issues, or feedback hit up [Julian Doherty](mailto:julian.doherty@lonelyplanet.com.au)/[@madlep](http://twitter.com/madlep)

Heres the goodies you get:

 * `add_couch_user` - Command line app that prompts you for a server username/password, then allows you to add other users. Basically automates what [the security page](http://wiki.apache.org/couchdb/Security_Features_Overview) describes for setting up user security.
