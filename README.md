Lonely Planet CouchDB tools
===========================

Just a bunch of useful scripts the [dev/ops team](http://lplabs.com) at [Lonely Planet](http://www.lonelyplanet.com) find useful for deploying and doing sysadmin type tasks on our CouchDB servers. Who knows, maybe someone else might find them useful as well.

Any issues, or feedback hit up [Julian Doherty](mailto:julian.doherty@lonelyplanet.com.au)/[@madlep](http://twitter.com/madlep)
